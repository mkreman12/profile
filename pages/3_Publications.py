    #### Action Recognition based Industrial Safety Violation Detection  
    Most PPE applications generate numerous false alarms because they generalize PPE requirements across all
    tasks, failing to account for task-specific needs.  
    This paper proposes a system that combines activity recognition with object detection to tailor PPE checks
    to specific actions, reducing false alarms.
